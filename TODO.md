# TODO

- [ ] Set up folder directories
  - Multiple directories?
  - Use react-router to mimic different pages?
- [ ] Install minimm dependencies such as React Router
  - Can even show Framer Motion which uses primarily hooks
- [ ] State management with `useReducer` and `useContext`
- [ ] Bonus (advanced) demo with `useCallback`, `useMemo` and `memo` to show how React rendering cycle
- [ ] Use a CSS framework (I'm leaning towards Tailwind)
- [ ] SVG Icon
